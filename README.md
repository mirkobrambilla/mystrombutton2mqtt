# a gateway between myStrom Wifi Button and MQTT gateway for Home Assistant integration 

## Intro

Home Assistant has some [support](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/mystrom#binary-sensor) for myStrom products. But I couldn't get functioning the buttons, I get a 401 error. I tried different combinations :
``` yaml
homeassistant:
    - type: trusted_networks
      trusted_networks:
        - 192.168.0.0/21
        - 192.168.1.40
        - 172.17.0.0/24
        - fd00::/8
  - type: legacy_api_password
    api_password: !secret api_password
http:
binary_sensor:
  - platform: mystrom
```
but it doesn't work and the [legacy_api_password](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/authentication/providers/#legacy-api-password) is deprecated and will be dropped in a future release.

So I decided to create this gateway.
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/schema.png "Functional Schema")

The goal is to have binary_sensors for single, double, long, _touch_, _wheel_final_ event and sensors for battery level and _wheel event_ (_italic_ only available for Button Plus) automatically created in Devices of Home Assistant. So Home Assistant can suggest Automations.

## Preparation of the button

You need to have a myStrom Wifi button with the minimal Firmware version: 2.74.10.

Please note the MAC address of your button. (only the numbers or letters). It will be know as __\[BUTTON_MAC\]__
You find this address on the purchase box or in myStrom application.
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/macaddress_box.jpg "MAC address on the box") or 
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/macaddress_android.jpg "MAC address in Android App")

On a Button Plus, the MAC address is written on the bottom:

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/mac_on_button_plus.jpg "MAC address on the bottom")




Identify the IP address of your wifi button. It will be known as __\[BUTTON_IP\]__ .

Identify the IP address of this GATEWAY. It will be known as __\[GATEWAY_IP\]__ .

Note that the port __8321__ is the default port of the gateway and can be modified in the settings.json file.

The following command will erase the previous actions of the button (single , double , long click and touch) and replace them by a generic action.

The actions created in the app seem to be working independently. 

Run the command :
```console
curl -v -d "generic=get://[GATEWAY_IP]:8321/api/mystrom/gen&single=&double=&long=&touch=" http://[BUTTON_IP]/api/v1/device/[BUTTON_MAC]
```

For the myStrom Wifi Button, the button has to be plugged to a charger and press to communicate with your Wifi.

For the myStrom Wifi Button +, you should remove the batteries and insert them again.

A positive setup should look like that:
```console
*   Trying [BUTTON_IP]...
* TCP_NODELAY set
* Connected to [BUTTON_IP] ([BUTTON_IP]) port 80 (#0)
> POST /api/v1/device/[BUTTON_MAC] HTTP/1.1
> Host: [BUTTON_IP]
> User-Agent: curl/7.52.1
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 77
> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
>
* upload completely sent off: 77 out of 77 bytes
< HTTP/1.1 200 OK
< Pragma: no-cache
< Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache
< Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
< Content-Type: application/json
< Content-Length: 126
< Connection: close
<
{
        "single": "",
        "double": "",
        "long": "",
        "touch": "",
        "generic": "get:\/\/[GATEWAY_IP]:8321\/api\/mystrom\/gen"
* Curl_http_done: called premature == 0
* Closing connection 0

```
The "\\/" in the generic URL are normal.


## Setting of the gateway

Update and rename the "resources/settings.json.sample" into "resources/settings.json"

Please add the __\[BUTTON_MAC\]__ and a short uniq name of your choice __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ in the section "button" or "buttons+" of the file "resources/settings.json". Personnally I have chosen the color of the rubber band as __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__.

```json
"button":{
		"123456789ABC" : {"name":"green"},
		"0123456789AB" : {"name":"orange"},
        "[BUTTON_MAC]" : {"name":"[CHOOSEN_NAME]"}
   },
```

For a button plus, you have to set the initial level __\[LEVEL\]__ (as integer), the minimum __\[LEVEL_MIN\]__ (as integer) and the maximum __\[LEVEL_MAX\]__ (as integer). The __\[LEVEL\]__ is controlled by the "wheel" event which is a difference between -127 and +127.
It will increase to the __\[LEVEL_MAX\]__ and decrease to the __\[LEVEL_MIN\]__.

```json
   "button+":{
		"3423456789AB" : {"name":"plus 1", "level_min": 0 , "level_max":255, "level":0},
        "[BUTTON_MAC]" : {"name":"[CHOOSEN_NAME]", "level_min": [LEVEL_MIN] , "level_max": [LEVEL_MAX], "level": [LEVEL]}
   }
```


## Running

Start the gateway with the command:
```console
python3 mystrombutton2mqtt.py ./resources/settings.json
```
### On the MQTT Broker

The following topics for each button will be published:
```python
## The Discovery Topics
## --------------------
[PREFIX]/sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_battery/config
# only if it's a "Button Plus"
[PREFIX]/sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_wheel/config  
[PREFIX]/sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_level/config  

[PREFIX]/binary_sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_single/config 
[PREFIX]/binary_sensor//myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_double/config 
[PREFIX]/binary_sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_long/config
# only if it's a "Button Plus"
[PREFIX]/binary_sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_touch/config  
[PREFIX]/binary_sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_final_wheel/config  
[PREFIX]/binary_sensor/myStrom/[BUTTON_MAC]_level/config  
## The state topics
## ----------------
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/single
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/double
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/long
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/battery
# only if it's a "Button Plus"
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/touch
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/wheel
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/wheel_final
myStrom/wifi_buttons/[CHOOSEN_NAME]_[BUTTON_MAC]/level
```
__\[PREFIX\]__ will be the prefix you specify in the ./resources/settings.json

For HomeAssistant, according to the [documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/mqtt/discovery/#discovery_prefix), the default discovery prefix is __homeassistant__ 

### On Home Assistant
On Home Assistant, you should have the same __\[MQTT_BROKER_IP\]__ in your "configuration.yaml":
```yaml
mqtt:
  broker: [MQTT_BROKER_IP]
  discovery: true
```
Once the gateway started, Home Assistant will show the button(s) in "Configuration" > "Devices" as "Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__" with "MQTT" in the integration column and "myStrom AG" as the manufacturer

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/devices.png "Wifi Buttons in Devices")

The battery information will be updated after each button action or every 12 hours when the button does a heartbeat.

## Running mystrombutton2mqtt as a service
If you run the gateway on a raspberry pi, you may want to run it as a service. To do so, create a file:
```console
sudo vi  /lib/systemd/system/mystrombutton2mqtt.service
```

Paste this code and replace the __\[DIRECTORY_PATH\]__ by the correct one:
```ini
[Unit]
Description=myStrom Wifi Buttons 2 MQTT Gateway Service
After=multi-user.target
Conflicts=getty@tty1.service

[Service]
Type=idle
User=pi
WorkingDirectory=[DIRECTORY_PATH]
ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 [DIRECTORY_PATH]/mystrombutton2mqtt.py [DIRECTORY_PATH]/resources/settings.json
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=always

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```
Enable the service:
```console
sudo systemctl enable mystrombutton2mqtt.service
```
Start the service:
```console
sudo systemctl start mystrombutton2mqtt.service
```
Check if it's active:
```console
sudo systemctl status mystrombutton2mqtt.service
```

## Running mystrombutton2mqtt with Docker

The included `Dockerfile` will build a basic image off `python:3`.  Running `docker-compose up` will build and start the image, and will mount the `resources/settings.json` file.

## Home Assistant Automations

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/djax666/mystrombutton2mqtt/master/static/button_automation.png "Wifi Button Automations")

You can use the __CREATE AUTOMATION WITH DEVICE__ UI Automation Generator.

Under __Do something when...__, the useful choices are: 
- myStrom Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __single turned on__
- myStrom Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __double turned on__
- myStrom Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __long turned on__
- myStrom Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __touch turned on__ (Button plus only)
- myStrom Wifi Button __\[CHOOSEN_NAME\]__ (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __battery battery level changed__

### Single click sample:
the __device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060b184ed880__, __platform: device__ and __type: turn_on__ have been added by the UI  Automation Generator.
Written manually, they would be replaced by: __platform: state__ and __to: "on"__
```yaml
- id: 'wibu_gris_single'
  alias: wibu gris - single
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060b184ed880
    domain: binary_sensor
    entity_id: binary_sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_gris_5ccf56789abc_single
    platform: device
    type: turned_on
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      message: Click once
    service: notify.telegram
```
### Double click sample:
```yaml
- id: 'wibu_gris_double'
  alias: wibu gris - double
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060b184ed880
    domain: binary_sensor
    entity_id: binary_sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_gris_5ccf56789abc_double
    platform: device
    type: turned_on
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      message: Click twice
    service: notify.telegram
```
### Long click sample:
```yaml
- id: 'wibu_gris_long'
  alias: WiBus gris - Long
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060b184ed880
    domain: binary_sensor
    entity_id: binary_sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_gris_5ccf56789abc_long
    platform: device
    type: turned_on
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      message: Long click
    service: notify.telegram
```
### Battery sample
For the battery event, as the battery dicovery value is -1, make sure to set  __above : -1__ in the trigger if you want to be notified when to recharge/change the battery:
```yaml
- id: 'wibu_gris_battery'
  alias: WiBu gris - Battery
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - above: -1
    below: 20
    device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060b184ed880
    domain: sensor
    entity_id: sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_gris_5ccf56789abc_battery
    platform: device
    type: battery_level
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      message: Please recharge the gray button!!!
    service: notify.telegram
```

### Button Plus Touch sample:
```yaml
- id: 'wibu_plus_touch'
  alias: WiBus Plus - Touch
  description: ''
  trigger:
  - device_id: 240e4c5a16da4b96a45e060a184ed880
    domain: binary_sensor
    entity_id: binary_sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_plus_5ccf56789aaa_long
    platform: device
    type: turned_on
  condition: []
  action:
  - data:
      message: Long click
    service: notify.telegram
```
### Button Plus Wheel Action sample
You could use _myStrom Wifi Button plus (__\[BUTTON_MAC\]__) __Wheel final turned on__ _, but the event is fired by the button quite long after the wheel action is finished.
But if you want a real time action for adjusting the brightness of a light, you can add in your __automations.yaml__:
```yaml
- id: wibu_plus_level
  alias: wibu plus - Level
  trigger:
  - entity_id: sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_plus_5ccf56789aaa_level
    platform: state
  condition: []
  action:
  - data_template:
      brightness: '{{ states(''sensor.mystrom_wifi_button_plus_5ccf56789aaa_level'')|int }}'
    entity_id: light.dimmable_bulb
    service: light.turn_on
```
